    <string name="a2">A2.Yes, of course!
However each restaurant order will be treated as a different order. So the delivery charges may be applicable for each order.</string>
    <string name="a3">A3. Each restaurant gives us a small percentage of the order amount.
        But for small orders we cannot afford to deliver within the commission we receive.
        Instead of declining such orders, we give you the option of delivering it to you, if you are prepared to pay the delivery charges.</string>
    <string name="a4">A4.We make every effort to keep the prices updated and accurate. Prices listed on this website are however approximate and subject to changes by the Restaurant and Taxes.
The final price is as per the ACTUAL BILL raised by the Restaurant and presented to you, at the time of the delivery.</string>
    <string name="a5">A5. Sorry, as a practice we do not give discounts as we work on very slim margins, already.
But, we could check with the Restaurant - and IF they offer any special discount, we would be happy to pass it on to you!</string>
    <string name="a6">A6. Not usually. But if the order is large and you give us advance notice (more than 2 hours),
        we could arrange it for you - but, this is at the sole discretion of Dial-a-Meal, based on prior commitments, etc.</string>
    <string name="a7">A7. After getting final notification of  placing order you can not cancel the order as the restaurant is notified and it begins preparing the order.
    but before that you van cancel the order.</string>
